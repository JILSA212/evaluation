Metrices used for evaluation
<ul>
<li>BLEU</li>
<li>METEOR</li>
<li>EDIT DISTANCE</li>
</ul>

How to run the code using python environment
<ul>
<li>Install the requirements using the command <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
<li>Run the code using the command <code>python main.py</code></li>
</ul>

Note: The conda environment was used during the development of the code. The requirement file contains the packages used in the conda environment. The code can be run using the python environment as well.

The results for the evaluation are produced using huggingface libraries. The codes for the same were references from the following links:
<ul>
<li>https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5</li>
<li>https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart</li>
</ul>

The codes were executed in Google colab and the python files for the same are given in the ref_codes folder.

main.py will generate the plots of edit distance, bleu and meteor scores for the models. It takes the reference file and results from the data folder.
time_plot.py and loss_plot.py take static data as an input and generate the plots for the same. They need to be run separately.
